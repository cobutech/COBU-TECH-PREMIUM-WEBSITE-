## Overview

This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly website with a clear authentication process (sign-up and login) leading to a personalized dashboard. It incorporates a multi-step sign-up and login, email verification (currently a bypass for development), and a dedicated homepage dashboard for logged-in users. The styling emphasizes a modern and premium aesthetic.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Step Authentication:** Clear and guided sign-up and login processes.
* **Email Verification Flow:** Includes a dedicated page for email verification (currently set for bypass during development).
* **Personalized Dashboard:** A dedicated homepage dashboard (`dashboard-home.html`) for logged-in users with a welcoming animation.
* **Organized File Structure:** Logical separation of HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript files for maintainability.
* **Modern Styling:** Utilizes CSS for a premium and responsive design.
* **Clear Navigation:** Easy navigation between different sections like contact support.
* **Basic Dashboard Functionality:** Includes sections for overview and data display (can be expanded).
